# ðŸ“Š Btop
Btop++ is a system monitor and process manager terminal program, providing readouts for CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, and Process activity, as well as sending signals such as KILL and TERM to individual processes.

It is enabled by default with many overridable options to control how it displays information.
