# Zoxide
Zoxide is a command substitute for the standard Unix command `cd`, which tracks frecency of visited directories to allow fuzzy navigation.

This module enables it with no options, but not replacing `cd` as many people configure, as to not potentially break commands relying on `cd`. Instead use the `z` command.
