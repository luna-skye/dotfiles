# Usage
## Adding New Hosts/Users
If you're installing on a fresh NixOS system, you may need to generate new host/user files and set up the respective configurations, or maybe you just want new hosts or users, our `.justfile` includes some recipes to make this faster and easier.

In a terminal, clone this repo and navigate to its directory, then run the following commands.

If the system doesn't yet have them installed, hop into a Nix shell with `just` and `nh` installed temporarily, so we can use them:
```bash
nix-shell -p just nh
```

Run the following command, replacing `<HOSTNAME>` with your system's hostname.
This will copy the host template to a new subdirectory of your `<HOSTNAME>` in the `./hosts` directory, and replace its templating values.
```bash
just new-host <HOSTNAME>
```

Next we optionally generate a new user with this command, which works in the same way.
```bash
just new-user <USERNAME>
```

Now add the new host and user to the `flake.nix` file inside the `nixosConfigurations` attribute set, toward the bottom of the file.

The `flake.nix` file includes a helper function called `mkNixosHost` which automatically registers our global modules, includes Home Manager, and sets up any users passed to it. It takes two arguments, the first being a string which is your hostname, the second is a list of strings which are the Home Manager users you want to include.
```nix
nixosConfigurations = {
  # ...
  <HOSTNAME> = mkNixosHost "<HOSTNAME>" [ "<USERNAME>" ];
};
```

Now we modify the `./hosts/<HOSTNAME>/configuration.nix` file, as this flake doesn't *yet* automatically register users in the NixOS system, only Home Manager. So navigate to and open the aforementioned file, and follow the instructions in the comment on line 13, replacing `USERNAME` with your user's name.

Finally, we can build and activate the system using a just recipe.
```bash
just build
```

## Building Configurations
There are multiple `just` recipes included to allow easy rebuilds of NixOS.

NixOS has a few actions it takes during deployment
1. Builds new generation from configuration
2. Activates the built generation, which switches your current system environment to it
3. Sets the generation as the default boot

These are the available rebuild related `just` recipes and which actions they take.
| Recipe  | Actions                          |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| `build` | Builds, activates, and sets boot |
| `test`  | Only builds and activates        |
| `dry`   | Only builds                      |

You can also check that the whole configuration evaluates successfully with the `check` recipe.

## Garbage Collection & Profile/Generation History
Nix can result in many versions of the same packages being installed, which consumes disk space. Garbage collection and management of profile/generation history can alleviate this.

Profiles are collections of system generations, while generations are the individual versioned system states from rebuilds inside a profile.

The following `just` recipes are available to help with this.
| Recipe        | Actions                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `history`     | Lists profile history                                                      |
| `generations` | Lists available generations                                                |
| `clean`       | Removes profiles/generations older than 7 days                             |
| `gc`          | Removes unused packages from the Nix Store and hardlinks identical entries |

## Nix REPL
The Nix REPL is a vital tool for debugging and exploring Nix code, this repo's `.justfile` includes two recipes to simplify loading things into the REPL.
| Recipe    | Actions                                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pkgs`    | Nix REPL with Nixpkgs loaded, useful for quick pkg searches                |
| `clean`   | Nix REPL with the `flake.nix` file loaded, great for debugging config      |

Over 90% of this configuration lives within the `modules` directory. These modules expose a variety of categorized options which allow overrides either per system, or per home-manager user.
More information about each of these modules, their options, and configuration, can be found within their respective directory's `README.md` file.
